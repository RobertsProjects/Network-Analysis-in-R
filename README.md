Covert Network Analysis in R

This project focuses on analyzing the relationships between websites affiliated with domestic terrorist groups in the United States.
Each node represents a website, and a directed edge from one website to another indicating a hyperlink connection. 
The purpose of this visualization is to uncover patterns of influence, cohesion, and brokerage within the network, identifying which websites serve as central hubs,
which are isolated, and whether tightly connected subgroups, cliques are present.

The project will use ’Domestic Terrorist Web Links’dataset. It is a directed 1-mode adjacency matrix network, which consist of hyperlinks between
websites connected to domestic terrorist groups in the United States. The dataset consists of 32 rows and 32 columns, forming a 32 x 32 matrix.
Each row and column represent a website, and the binary cell values indicate whether a hyperlink present, 1 if there is a link, 0 if there is no link
between them.
